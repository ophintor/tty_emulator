# tty_emulator

tty_emulator is a simple bash script that "emulates" the execution of a set of commands by using the pv command. It reads from a text file sitting in the same directory called commands.txt.

The script came from the need to record demos without having to worry too much about the typing bit of it. It helps me to avoid typos, no thinking about which command is the next, no copy and pasting and so on. I just focus on my speech while just pressing enter when needed: once to emulate the typing of the command, and a second time to run the actual command.

Check the demo:
